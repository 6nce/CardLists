Welcome to the Sports Cards JSON Repository, your ultimate destination for exploring sports card data in a structured and open-source format. This repository features comprehensive datasets for baseball cards and aims to expand to include football, hockey, and more. Developers, collectors, and enthusiasts alike can use this resource to power their projects such as: 
* Integrating a Baseball Card database into your Mobile or Web Application
* Providing datasets for a Machine Learning model
* Using them as checklists for your own personal collection

## Why This Repository?

The Sports Cards JSON Repository addresses the gap in freely accessible, high-quality sports card datasets. By providing open data, we empower developers to:

- Create innovative tools for sports card collectors.
- Develop offline applications for managing and analyzing card collections.
- Use structured data for building machine learning models or generating insights.

Whether you're working on a trading card tracker, a sports card price guide, or exploring trends in sports memorabilia, this repository offers a solid foundation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by sports and card sets. Each set is represented by a JSON file that adheres to our schema. Below is an example of the structure:

```json

  "attributes": [
    {
      "attribute": "Rookie Card",
      "note": "First appearance of player"
    }
  ],
  "sets": [
    {
      "name": "Factory Set",
      "notes": ["Complete set included"],
      "numberedTo": 1000,
      "variations": [
        {
          "variation": "Reverse Back",
          "note": "Reverse back facing right"
        }
      ],
      "parallels": [
        {
          "name": "Gold Edition",
          "numberedTo": 1000,
          "notes": ["Limited edition release"]
        }
      ],
      "cards": [

              "note": "Misprint on back"
            }
          ],
          "parallels": [
            {
              "name": "Gold Edition",
              "numberedTo": 1000,
              "notes": ["Serial numbered"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]

| Language       | Example File            |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| **C#**         | `src/csharp/Program.cs` |
| **Python**     | `src/python/main.py`    |
